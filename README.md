# applescript

Scripts that I like to use to make life easier.

## Droplet

See Droplet.html for all the websites that I had to browse before compiling and putting together their code. 

## Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter_notebook.scpt allows me to drag and drop ipynb files into a droplet app that I can put onto the Finder toolbar which will open the directory of file in Terminal 
and then use nbopen to open the file from Terminal.

(There is a second applescript repository as to not confuse you with other files).
