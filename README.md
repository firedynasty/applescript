# applescript

Scripts that I like to use to make life easier.

##Droplet

See Droplet.html for all the websites that I had to browse before compiling and putting together their code. 

##Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter_notebook.scpt allows me to drag and drop ipynb files into a droplet app that I can put onto the Finder toolbar which will open the directory of file in Terminal 
and then use nbopen to open the file from Terminal.

(There is a second applescript repository as to not confuse you with other files). 

## Splitting a string

How to split a string in applescript, here I am splitting with a "." So if you have "javascript.js" you can get it to be split like "javascript" and "js".  Then if you only want "javascript" you can call it by the first item.
